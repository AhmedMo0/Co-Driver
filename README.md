# CO-Driver
This project provides a solution to help drivers using a mobile app by notifying them of traffic lights, speed bumps, and radars before reaching them on the road and Informing the driver if he exceeds the safe distance between him and the cars in front of him. 

This aims to solve this problem by providing drivers with real-time information about these obstacles and allowing them to plan their routes accordingly. The application uses advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze real-time traffic data and notify drivers about traffic lights, speed bumps, and radars on their planned routes.


## Project Functionalities

### 1. Notify the driver before he reaches a speed bump, radar, or traffic light.

### 2. Inform the driver if he exceeds the speed limit.

### 3. Inform the driver when exceeding the safe distance.

### 4. Warn the driver if he overtakes dangerously.

### 5. Give the driver an overall summary of his driving.

### 6. Show stored Geolocation of signs.

### 7. Speech notification to inform the user about new events, updates, or messages in an app.
